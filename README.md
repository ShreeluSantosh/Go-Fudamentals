# anonAuth

An anonymous authentication that allows users to access online services without revealing their identities.

These days, it is common for concerns to rise around data privacy, especially privacy of sensitive personal data. Thus, there is a need for protection of the following types of data against unauthorized access, misuse, and leaks:
<ul>
  <li>Full name</li>
  <li>Date of birth</li>
  <li>home address, city, or country</li>
  <li>email address, phone number, or social media accounts</li>
  <li>race, ethnicity, caste, or nationality</li>
  <li>sexual orientation</li>
</ul>

So, using the above information as part of online identity puts individuals at risk of revealing their identifiable credentials (through database leaks, unauthorized access, or reconnaissance).

The gist of this project is to provide the users a way to anonymize their online credentials, thus separating personally identifiable information from their credentials.
